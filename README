NAME
    email-tunnel - Create a tunnel to get email services (POP/IMAP/SMTP) through outbound firewall filters.

SYNOPSIS
    email-tunnel [-h] {start|stop|restart|status}

DESCRIPTION
    The email-tunnel utility creates a tunnel to get email services
    (POP/IMAP/SMTP) through outbound firewall filters. It uses the
    LocalForward feature of ssh.

    Actually, it can be used to setup tunnels for any TCP services,
    but my use case is email.

    The following packages must be installed on the local system:

        * daemon
        * ssh

    To use this utility, you will need to create an "email-tunnel"
    entry in your .ssh/config file. Something like:

        Host            email-tunnel
          HostName        shell.soaustin.net
          User            chip
          LocalForward    4143 mail.soaustin.net:143
          LocalForward    4587 mail.soaustin.net:587

    In this example, I am setting up two tunnels for IMAP and SMTP/submission services on mail.soaustin.net. The tunnels run through an ssh session to shell.soaustin.net, upon which I have a login account.

OPTIONS
    -h    Display this help message.

FILES
    /home/crosenthal/var/run/email-tunnel.pid
        PID of (last) running ssh process that creates the tunnel.

    /home/crosenthal/var/log/email-tunnel.log
        Output from the ssh process the creates the tunnel.
